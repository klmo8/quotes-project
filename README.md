# CS and Stoic Quote Generator  

A simple web app that finds and displays curated quotes from famous computer scientists, technologists, mathematicians, and stoics.

## Description

This project was used to introduce me to the Django framework. Previously, I had minimal web development experience (beyond basic HTML/CSS). This project introduced me to concepts of function-based views, url routing, template inheritance, and other features of the framework. Although it could benefit from many additions, I will probably let this project R.I.P as I move onto bigger and better things. If interested, check out my 2nd Django project (Podcast Sharing App) to see my evolution as a web developer.
